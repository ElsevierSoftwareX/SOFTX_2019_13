%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Got rid of the Scrollbars in the GUI that did not go away even when maximizing the GUI's window

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Change extrapolation.m
Changed the initial values of the optimization for Swift and Voce extrapolations from x0 = [1 0.002 0.5]; to x0 = [1 1 0.5];
This yield more stable behaviour as in some cases the fits have been really bad.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Changed filename of the GUI to a name without any versioning in it.
